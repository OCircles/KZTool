Currently supports all Steam versions from 1.0.0 to 1.0.5 and GoG 1.0.0, I don't own the GoG version however so I can't support that any further unless someone gifts it to me or provides the current room offset.

* Hotkeys are rebindable, click the corresponding textboxs
* Switching between certain rooms can crash your game, if that happens just try switching from another room
* Using hard reset (force reload the room, useful during replays or cutscenes) can also crash for some reason, so you might want to rebind it from R.

Currently hotkeys are not saved; I was about to add it then I got sidetracked, next update will have it though.

Do note that using this on speedrun mode can mess up your golds (I have a 30s gold on chinatown now lol). I have an idea on how to circumvent this, but for now you'll just have to live with it.
