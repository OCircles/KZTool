Currently supports all Steam versions from 1.0.0 to 1.0.5 and GoG 1.0.0, I don't own the GoG version however so I can't support that any further unless someone gifts it to me or provides the current room offset.

* Hotkeys are rebindable, click the corresponding textboxs
* Switching between certain rooms can crash your game, if that happens just try switching from another room
* Using hard reset (force reload the room, useful during replays or cutscenes) can also crash for some reason, so you might want to rebind it from R.

**Using this on speedrun mode can mess up your best time records!** Be careful with finishing stages if they're important to you.

## Todo

* Save hotkeys
* Force speedrun stage timer to something high to prevent fake best time records
* Add offsets to an embedded XML list for easier maintenance and cleaner code
