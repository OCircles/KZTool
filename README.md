* Hotkeys are rebindable, click the corresponding textboxs
* Switching between certain rooms can crash your game, if that happens just try switching from another room
* Using hard reset (force reload the room, useful during replays or cutscenes) can also crash for some reason, so you might want to rebind it from R.

**Using this on speedrun mode can mess up your best time records!** Be careful with finishing stages if they're important to you.
